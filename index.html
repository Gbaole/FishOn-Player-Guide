                I am doing this because too many new players are joining and spamming the same questions in the chat,
                and I want a quick
                way to help them out. This is not an official wiki; it is a community-contributed guide created by
                members to assist new

                    <p>
                        To begin, right-click to cast your rod into a body of water. After waiting for a short time, a
                        fish will approach
                        your bobber. When this occurs, the screen will display the text <span
                            class="font-semibold text-yellow-500">"Bite!"</span> and you will hear a splashing sound. At
                        this time,
                        right-click once to hook the fish.

                    <p>
                        This will begin the fish-catching minigame. To complete the minigame and catch the fish, the
                        player must prevent the
                        right edge of the <span class="text-blue-600">blue bar</span> from hitting either the left or
                        right side of the

                            bar</span> within the <span class="text-yellow-500">yellow rectangle</span> for a short

                            bar</span> indicates
                        how close the player is to catching the fish. The <span class="text-green-600">green bar</span>
                        increases rapidly
                        when the right side edge of the <span class="text-blue-600">blue bar</span> is within the <span
                            class="text-yellow-500">yellow rectangle</span>. If the player manages to fully fill the
                        <span class="text-green-600">green bar</span>, they will catch the fish.

                                You can get a pet by fishing at every location. Pets have a chance to drop when you
                                catch a fish. Each location has a different pet. Pets have a rarity value that
                                progresses from common, rare, epic, legendary, and mythical. A pet's rarity can be
                                raised by merging two level 100 pets with the same Pet Type and Rarity. The resulting
                                merged
                                pet will be 1 rarity level higher than the merged pets and their stats will be combined
                                and averaged.

                                Every location has a fish merchant you can sell to and a location npc for you to tp to
                                others locations

                            What is shard used for and How do you can craft armor:
                            <span class="font-thin rounded">
                                Players can fish up shards at all locations. Every location has a climate. Shard is
                                determined by the climate of the location. You
                                can craft armor with the shard you get like normal minecraft but no helmet. You can
                                upgrade your armor up to tier 5. All armor can be upgraded at the Forger NPC (located
                                near the Artisan NPC) with
                                shards, which will upgrade its tier by 1, up to a maximum of 5. You will need to
                                indentify it at Indentifier NPC (located near the Artisan NPC) to see the quality of the
                                armor. And you can scrap it at the scrapper NPC (located behind Indentifier and forge
                                NPC) to get some shards back.
                                The color of the armor changes slightly with every tier. When you craft new armor it is
                                tier
                                1. From then tier 2 will need <span class="bg-yellow-300 font-semibold">16

                                Quests require players to catch a certain amount of fish of one rarity or size. They may
                                provide money,
                                XP, location XP, pets, and shards when completed. The amount of fish needed per quest
                                goes up with the
                                player's level.

                                Quests come in three difficulties which can be selected by the player: Easy, Medium, and
                                Hard.
                                Requirements, rewards, and abandon cost vary by difficulty. Easy quests are available at
                                any level,
                                Medium quests require level 20, and Hard quests require level 50.
